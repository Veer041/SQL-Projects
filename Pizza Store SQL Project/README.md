## Project Overview

This project is an analysis of a pizza store's sales and customer data using SQL. The goal is to derive key insights into customer behavior, product performance, and overall store revenue. By utilizing SQL queries, we explored various sales metrics to help optimize store operations and product offerings.

### Objectives
- **Total Orders and Revenue**: Calculate the total number of orders and revenue generated from pizza sales.
- **Pizza Preferences**: Identify the most popular pizza sizes and types ordered by customers.
- **Category & Time Analysis**: Explore order distribution across pizza categories and peak order times during the day.
- **Advanced Insights**: Analyze the contribution of each pizza type to total revenue and determine top-performing pizzas.

## Key Areas of Analysis
- **Revenue Breakdown**: Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
- **Cumulative Revenue**: Analyze how revenue accumulates over time.
- **Top Pizza Types**: Determine the top 3 most ordered pizzas by revenue for each category.
- **Order Patterns**: Identify the distribution of orders by hour of the day and average pizzas ordered per day.
- **Popular Items**: List the top 5 most ordered pizza types, along with quantities.

## SQL Queries and Schema
The SQL queries used in the project were developed to join several tables, including `orders`, `order_details`, `pizzas`, and `pizza_types`. These queries provided insights on key performance indicators such as total sales, pizza preferences, and time-based order analysis.

## Schema Overview
